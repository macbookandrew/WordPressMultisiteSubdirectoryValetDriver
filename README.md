# WordPress Multisite Subdirectory Valet Driver

A custom driver for [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet) that adds compatibility for WordPress multisite installs that use the subdirectory configuration.

## Compatibility

| -------------:| --------------:|
| 3.x           | 1.x            |
| 4.x           | 2.x            |

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
1. `cp WordPressMultisiteSubdirectoryValetDriver.php ~/.config/valet/Drivers`
1. Make sure your wp-config.php file has at least one of WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE or MULTISITE constants defined.
1. Celebrate the pain you just avoided!

## Installs with WordPress root files in a subdirectory

If your install has WordPress root files in a subdirectory (such as a submodule), simply change the class property `$wp_root` from false to the root directory name.
